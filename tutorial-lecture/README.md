# tutorial-lecture
Student Modeling (Bayesian Knowledge Tracing) lecture for the JDPLS program. 

If you're interested in exploring more, you could try our course materials in our Machine Learning for Behavioral Data course ([mlbd-2023](https://github.com/epfl-ml4ed/mlbd-2023)) and look at the lecture videos on [SwitchTube](https://mediaspace.epfl.ch/channel/CS-421+Machine+learning+for+behavioral+data/30584).

### Setup
On the day of the lecture, you can complete the following steps to have the relevant material in your Noto environment.

Once you have your repository set up as per steps 1 through 8 in the [JDPLS Noto setup guide](../jdpls-tutorial), click on the git symbol in the left column. Then, click on the first cloud symbol on top! This should let you recieve new files that we've added for the lecture.

### Notebooks
Please click on the `student_modeling.ipynb` notebook. Run the cells at the top, and work through the exercises on per-skill metrics and interpreting learning curves.

We will publish the `student_modeling_solution.ipynb` notebook after the lecture.
